The tool **XYZ** is _really useful_ for computing XYZ...

However, it can be challenging to install on Mac OS because:

- a
- b
- c

First, you need to install dependencies:

```bash
$ brew install zlib bgzip2
$ pip install xyz
```

Then you can import `xyz` in your Python code:

```python
from xyz import biology

def test():
    for x in biology.stuff():
        print(x)

```

To use this library in your R code:

```R
install.packages("xyz")
library(xyz)
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
```
